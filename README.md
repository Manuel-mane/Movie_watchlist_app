# Movie Watchlist app


In this repo I combined python with PostgreSQL using psycopg2 python library, to create an interactive app. Above the basic setup, in a future I will be improving this app by adding other options to interact with the user such as a GUI interface. 

## Requirements:
* Python 3.8 and above  [(click here to download)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* In this project, for convenience, I used ElephantSQL  [(click here to open)](https://www.elephantsql.com/) as the postgreSQL source. You must open an account, create an instance (there is a free option), and create a table. Once you have your table, copy the URL and paste it in .env.example as the DATABASE_URL variable.
* dotenv library (Command: **pip install python-dotenv**) . This library is used to specify environment variables.
